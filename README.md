# 42_Libft
Libft is a 42 School project, library of C functions that I use for other projects.  
Most of these are recode of functions from standard C-libraries.  

### Among them:
ft_str* - for strings  
ft_lst* - for lists   
ft_mem* - for work with memory   
ft_is* - for checking char   
ft_atoi and ft_itoa - my implementation of atoi and itoa functions  
get_next_line - for read line by line from file descriptor   
ft_printf - my implementation of printf function   

#### Usage:
`make`
