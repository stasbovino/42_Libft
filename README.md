# libft
Libft is a library of C functions that I use for other projects.\
Most of these are recode of functions from standard C-libraries.\
### Among them:
ft_str* - for strings\
ft_lst* - for lists\
ft_mem* - for work with memory\
ft_is* - for checking char\
ft_atoi and ft_itoa\
get_next_line - for read line by line from file descriptor\
ft_printf - my recode of printf function
